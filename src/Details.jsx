                As an undergraduate in computer engineering with a keen interest in blockchain technology, I've honed my skills in frontend development, specializing in React, Javascript and TailwindCSS while also delving into backend development with Node.js and Express.js. I have experience in Flutter development as well. Beyond coding, I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology, sports, and society, and enjoy playing lawn tennis, particularly admiring Novak Djokovic. In my downtime, I indulge in reading, listening soulful music, and exploring podcasts. My diverse interests and dedication to learning drive me to make meaningful contributions in the tech industry. </p>
